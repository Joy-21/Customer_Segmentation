Customer Segmentation Project: E-Commerce Dataset
Overview
This project focuses on Customer Segmentation using RFM analysis and K-Means clustering to group e-commerce customers into meaningful segments. The goal is to better understand customer behavior and provide actionable insights for tailored marketing strategies.

Purpose of the Project
The primary objectives of this project are:
1. Understand Customer Behavior: Use RFM analysis to identify patterns in purchasing behavior.
2. Group Similar Customers: Cluster customers into distinct groups for targeted marketing.
3. Improve Business Decisions: Provide actionable insights to optimize customer retention, loyalty, and engagement.

Step-by-Step Process
Step 1: Load and Inspect the Data
- Purpose: Load the dataset and ensure it is in the correct format for analysis.
- Actions:
  - Imported the dataset using pandas.
  - Inspected the first few rows, column names, and missing values.
- Why? Provides an overview of the dataset and helps identify any data issues (e.g., missing values, incorrect formats).

Step 2: Clean the Data
- Purpose: Remove unnecessary or incomplete data.
- Actions:
  - Dropped rows with missing CustomerID.
  - Checked for remaining missing values.
- Why? Ensures the dataset is clean and ready for analysis, preventing inaccuracies.

Step 3: Add a Total Price Column
- Purpose: Calculate the total revenue generated per transaction.
- Actions:
  - Created a new column, TotalPrice, by multiplying Quantity and UnitPrice.
- Why? This column is needed to compute the Monetary value in RFM analysis.

Step 4: Prepare for RFM Analysis
- Purpose: Calculate RFM metrics (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) for each customer.
- Actions:
  - Recency: Days since the customerâ€™s last purchase.
  - Frequency: Number of invoices associated with the customer.
  - Monetary: Total spending by the customer.
- Why? These metrics are essential for understanding customer behavior.

Step 5: Normalize the Data
- Purpose: Scale RFM metrics to the same range for clustering.
- Actions:
  - Used MinMaxScaler to scale Recency, Frequency, and Monetary values between 0 and 1.
- Why? Prevents any single metric from dominating the clustering process.

Step 6: Apply K-Means Clustering
- Purpose: Group customers based on their RFM metrics.
- Actions:
  - Applied the K-Means algorithm to cluster customers into 4 groups.
  - Added cluster labels to the RFM table.
- Why? Clustering helps identify distinct customer groups with similar behaviors.

Step 7: Evaluate Clustering
- Purpose: Measure the quality of the clusters.
- Actions:
  - Calculated the silhouette score, which indicates how well-separated the clusters are.
- Why? A higher silhouette score means better-defined and meaningful clusters.

Step 8: Visualize the Clusters
- Purpose: Explore the distribution of clusters across RFM metrics.
- Actions:
  - Created scatter plots for combinations of Recency, Frequency, and Monetary.
- Why? Visualization helps in understanding cluster characteristics and validating results.

Step 9: Interpret the Clusters
- Purpose: Analyze and label each cluster based on its average RFM metrics.
- Actions:
  - Calculated average Recency, Frequency, and Monetary values for each cluster.
  - Mapped cluster labels to meaningful segment names (e.g., Loyal Customers, Dormant Customers).
- Why? Provides actionable insights for business decisions.

Step 10: Create a Customer Segmentation Report
- Purpose: Summarize findings and save the segmented data.
- Actions:
  - Saved the segmented RFM table to a CSV file.
  - Documented characteristics of each segment for future use.
- Why? Enables businesses to apply targeted marketing strategies.

Cluster Insights
| Cluster           | Characteristics                                                                                         | Suggested Actions                                                                 |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Loyal Customers   | High frequency and monetary value, low recency. These are your best customers.                         | Offer loyalty programs, exclusive discounts, and personalized offers.            |
| Dormant Customers | Low frequency and monetary value, high recency.                                                      | Re-engage with targeted discounts, email campaigns, or special offers.           |
| New Customers     | Low frequency, low monetary value, and low recency.                                                  | Nurture with onboarding offers, guides, and incentives to drive repeat purchases.|
| One-Time Spenders | High monetary value, high recency, but low frequency.                                                | Encourage repeat purchases through follow-up offers and post-purchase engagement.|

Conclusion
**Key Takeaways**:
1. Customer Behavior: The segmentation revealed distinct patterns in customer behavior, helping identify the most valuable customers (Loyal Customers) and those needing re-engagement (Dormant Customers).
2. Actionable Insights:
   - Loyal Customers: Focus on retention and rewards.
   - Dormant Customers: Use campaigns to win them back.
   - New Customers: Build relationships to turn them into loyal customers.
   - One-Time Spenders: Motivate repeat purchases.
3. Business Impact:
   - Improved targeting for marketing efforts.
   - Increased customer retention and revenue.
   - Optimized resource allocation based on customer value.

This segmentation project provides a robust foundation for data-driven decision-making, enhancing customer satisfaction and boosting business growth.
